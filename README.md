## üìç Overview

The "philo" project is a simulation of the dining philosophers problem, where the core functionality revolves around multiple philosophers trying to pick up forks to eat in a synchronized manner. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate synchronization and resource allocation using mutex locks, while also considering aspects like monitoring philosopher deaths and managing game settings. The value proposition lies in its ability to showcase the challenges and solutions of concurrent programming, helping developers gain a better understanding of synchronization problems and how to address them.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

| Feature                | Description                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **‚öôÔ∏è Architecture**     | The codebase follows a modular architecture, separating functionalities into different files. The dining philosophers problem is solved using multithreading and synchronization with mutexes. |
| **üìñ Documentation**   | The codebase includes a header file with extensive comments, providing clear explanations of the program structure, function prototypes, and constants. The code itself is well-commented, aiding understanding. |
| **üîó Dependencies**    | The codebase relies on standard C libraries and does not have any external dependencies. |
| **üß© Modularity**      | The codebase organizes the project into separate files, with each file handling a specific aspect of the simulation, such as error handling, game logic, initialization, and utility functions. This modular approach enhances code readability and maintainability. |
| **‚úîÔ∏è Testing**          | The codebase does not explicitly include tests. However, the simulation aspect allows manual validation by observing the expected behavior of the philosophers and their actions. |
| **‚ö°Ô∏è Performance**      | The codebase efficiently handles synchronization and resource allocation through the use of mutexes, ensuring proper coordination among the philosophers. It also utilizes multithreading to run the simulation concurrently. |
| **üîê Security**        | The codebase does not focus on security measures as the primary goal is to simulate the dining philosophers problem. However, it correctly manages shared resources and ensures proper synchronization to prevent race conditions. |
| **üîÄ Version Control** | The codebase uses Git for version control, allowing collaboration, tracking changes, and maintaining the project's history. |
| **üîå Integrations**    | The codebase does not have any direct integrations with external systems or services. |
| **üì∂ Scalability**     | The codebase does not explicitly address scalability. However, it can handle multiple philosophers and forks efficiently due to its multithreaded implementation. To handle significant scalability, further design considerations may be required. |
